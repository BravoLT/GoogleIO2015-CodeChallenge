# Challenge 3 - Find the longest palindrome

For some reason, we find a string of characters that is the same forwards and backwards interesting enough that it merits it's own word and a plethora of programming challenges to find them.  In this challenge you will write a program that will analyze an input file and, considering only alphanumeric characters(no punctuation, spaces, etc), will find and print the length of the longest palindrome in the file.  You have been provided a sample file for testing.
