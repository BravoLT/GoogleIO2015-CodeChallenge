# Challenge 2 - Name Ranking
Write a program that will take an input file of names(see the sample file) and print the top 10 names in descending order by frequency.  You have been provided a test file as an example that you may use to test.  The output should be formatted to print both the name and the number of times it is encountered like so:

```
Pamela - 25
Michelle - 23
Sara - 20
Andrea - 16
```
