# Challenge 3 - Find the longest palindrome

For some reason, we as humans find a string of characters that is the same forwards and backwards interesting enough that it merits it's own word and a pletora of programming challenges to find them.  In this challenge you will write a program that will analyze an input file that, when considering only alphanumeric characters(no punctuation, spaces, etc), will find and print the longest palindrome.  The answer should be the only output of the program.
